git don't keep track of folders. That is when a new folder is created we don't need to commit that. It is because , gits way of keeping tracks is by storing the differences. When a new folder is created , git has nothing to compare it to, so nothing is commited.


merging shouldn't be done directly. 
first a pull request must be created for it to be reviewed by everyone and then only it should be merged.
then the owner (the person having the right to merge , merges the branch.)
